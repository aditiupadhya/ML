# Implementing ML algorithms using dataset from uci-repository 'wine_red-quality' to find the best model out of following:
1.Linear Regression
2.Ridge
3.Lasso
4.Logistic Regression
5.KNN
6.Descision Tree
7.SVC and SVR
8.Random Forest(Random forest with hyper parameter tuning)

Creating model as both :
i.single input-single output 
ii.batch input-batch output

In addition, creating a pickle file for the above
